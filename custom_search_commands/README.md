# Overview of custom search commands

Custom search commands are user-defined Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) commands implemented in Python scripts that extend SPL to serve your specific needs. Custom search commands let you perform additional data analysis in Splunk Cloud Platform or Splunk Enterprise.

Here are some use cases for custom search commands.

* You want to process data in a way that Splunk software hasn't handled yet.
